# LifeTerm
Game of life editor right on your terminal because why not? ðŸ¤·

![](./assets/demo.png)

I use the [hashlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashlife) algorithm to represent the universe and update cells.

# How to 
### RUN
> The grid is based on the screen size of your terminal, so make sure you larger your screen before run

### Build
`make lifeterm`
### Run
Init an empty world

`./lifeterm.o`

Lifeterm is currently support to load pattern in Macrocell(.mc) format. Just type:

`./lifeterm.o {path}`
